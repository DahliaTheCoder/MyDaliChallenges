        I am a '24 pursuing Computer science modified with Engineering Sciences here at Dartmouth College. Background-wise, I come from a tiny yet mindblowingly beautiful and peaceful country called Rwanda. I am a passionate learner and I love using the knowledge and skills I have to create an impact in the world, and that is why I am applying to work at DALI lab, where I will get various opportunities that will push me out of my comfort zone to learn new skills while also working on challenging, yet impactful projects that will create value in the Dartmouth community and beyond. 

        That said, in my free time, I love reading books and listening to music, especially <em>Afromusic</em>. It's my favorite genre of music (if I can call it a genre!). <em>Pro-Tip</em>: If you don't know any Afrobeat song, please bless your ears and search any African song, you will thank me later! 
        Sometimes, I also write, and <a href="https://journeys.dartmouth.edu/insidemyheart/">here</a> you can find some of my oped articles.
