# Challenge: Building a website

To execute this challenge, I used javascript, css, and html to build a website from scratch. The website I build has a home page that contains two pictures and a couple welcoming sentences and then it also contains embedded links to an AboutMe page and to my Dartmouth journeys portfolio. To make this website, I used two code files: one html file to to create the website and add all necessary contents to it and one css file to help in editing and beautifying the website appearance. In my html file (named, index.html), I used various elements and selectors like <body>, <head>, <header>, etc to add different parts of the website to their respective pages. Then I used the main.css file to make all the editings needed to improve the appearance of my website content and ensure that each part is in a position it's supposed to be in.

  Due to limited time and skills at the moment, I opted to build a basic website like this because I didn't have enough time to create a more advanced and better website.
